we have the end_point

the candidates will be the angles of the 3 rotors

the evaluation function will return the end point on x,y,z that will has the arm

this value evaluated need to get the diferential between the actual point and the objetive point
// euclidean distance, sqrt(sum((act(dim i) - obj(dim i))**2))

this value find the min value will be the best answer
